Styleguide
In real projects the UI typically goes through several stages:

Wireframes
Designs
Style guides
For this app you'll be given a complete style guide that provides the HTML and CSS for all of the components you'll be building. This way you can focus on JS and React, not CSS ðŸ˜€

You can view the styleguide live at https://galvanize-inbox-styleguide.herokuapp.com/
Or you can download and run it locally https://github.com/gSchool/inbox-styleguide
You can also find a JSON file with seed data there as well
Create the App
Create the app using create-react-app
Create a github repository called react-inbox
Setup CSS
Install Bootstrap and Font Awesome with this:

yarn add bootstrap@3
yarn add font-awesome
Then in src/index.js add the following lines above index.css:

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap-theme.css';
import 'font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css';

// this line already exists...
import './index.css';
From the styleguide copy the CSS from the CSS tab into index.css

NOTE: If you notice your messages "jumping" to the side when you hover, then you probably included bootstrap below index.css, which is incorrect.

Component Hierarchy
Normally you get to decide how to organize components when you create an app. For this app, make sure have at least:

An App component
A Messages (or MessageList) component
A Message component
A Toolbar component
This will be important for the next unit on testing, where you'll test each of those 4 components using a different strategy.

Stories
There are a lot of stories here, which is intentional. The idea is for you to become fluent with these basic concepts before moving on to the more complex aspects of React.



Message Display
Users should see a list of messages with the correct styles

When a user views the app
Then they should see a list of messages with their subjects
If the message is read, it should have the read style
If the message is unread, it should have the unread
If the message is selected, it should have the selected style and the box should be checked
If there are labels on a message, they should appear
If the message is starred, then the star should be filled in, otherwise it should be empty
Starring
Users should be able to star and unstar a message.

When a user clicks the star next to a message
Then it should toggle whether the message is starred or not
For example if it was starred, and you clicked on it, it should be unstarred
Selecting Individual Messages
Users should be able to select and deselect individual messages.

When a user checks the checkbox on a message
Then the message should be highlighted

When a user unchecks the checkbox on a message
Then the message should _not_ be highlighted
Bulk Select / Deselect
Users should be able to select and deselect messages.

Given that no messages are selected
When a user checks the "Select All" checkbox
Then it should check all messages (and highlight them)

Given that some messages are selected
When a user checks the "Select All" checkbox
Then it should check all messages (and highlight them)

Given that all messages are selected
When a user unchecks the "Select All" checkbox
Then it should uncheck all messages (and unhighlight them)
Marking Messages as Read
Users should be able to mark messages as read.

When a user selects messages
And presses "Mark As Read"
Then each selected message should be marked as read
And should no longer be bold
Marking Messages as Unread
Users should be able to mark messages as unread.

When a user selects messages
And presses "Mark As Unread"
Then each selected message should be marked as unread
And should should appear bold
Deleting Messages
Users should be able to delete selected messages

When a user selects messages
And presses "Delete" (the Trash icon)
Then each selected message should be removed from the list
And the unread count should update
And "Select All" button should update
Adding Labels
When a user selects messages from the sidebar
And chooses a label from the "Add Label" dropdown
Then that label should be added to all selected messages
But if the message already contains the label then it should not be added twice
NOTE: It's OK to hard-code the list of labels

Removing Labels
When a user selects messages from the sidebar
And chooses a label from the "Remove Label" dropdown
Then that label should be removed from all of the selected messages that contain the label
NOTE: It's OK to hard-code the list of labels

NOTE: If you try to remove a label from a message that doesn't have that label, there should be no errors

Unread Message Count
Users should always see the number of unread messages

When a user changes which messages are read / unread
Then the unread count in the upper right-hand corner should update
And when there are 0 unread messages it should display "0 unread messages"
And when there is 1 unread message it should display "1 unread message"
And when there's more than 1 unread message it should display "_n_ unread messages"
Select All Button State
Users should see the state of the select all button change as messages are selected

When no messages are checked
Then the "Select All" button should be in the "unchecked" state

When some messages are checked
Then the "Select All" button should be in the "half-checked" state

When all messages are checked
Then the "Select All" button should be in the "checked" state
NOTE: the "Select All" button must stay in sync at all times.

Select All Button State
Users should not be able to click on toolbar items when no messages are selected
